# 6-Keys-Micropad-with-Knob
This is my simple six-button micropad with its knob, it's a simple thing I made in a few hours and I plan to improve its case in the future.

# Firmware:
The firmware is still in progress and the screen has not yet been integrated. So far, the code only integrates the knob that increases/decreases the volume and pauses the content when pressed. The micropad has these six programmed functions: undo, redo, copy, paste, quick save, and switch screen.

# Schematic and PCB:
Making the PCB and the schematic was a headache because it was the first time I ever used KiCad, so I had a lot of errors that I had to fix and had to redo the PCB and the schematic several times.

# Case:
Making the case was also a headache because it was also the first time I used Fusion360, so I was very lost, but by following tutorials I managed to make an acceptable case, although I plan to improve it in the future.
